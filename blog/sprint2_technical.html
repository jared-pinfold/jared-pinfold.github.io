        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Classes Vs. IDs</h2>
        <br>
            <p>Classes and IDs are attributes which can be applied to HTML "objects". They don't do anything in and of themselves, but you can apply styling rules and added functionality which only applies to those objects.</p>
            <p>The difference between the two is a Class can be applied to a group of objects - let's say some images of giraffes, for example - whereas an ID should only be applied to a specific object - for example your one favorite giraffe photo. You can have any number of Classes attached to an object, and an object can have a mixture of Classes and IDs if you want. The big rule is, each ID has to be unique to a particular object (I'll explain why in a bit).</p>
            <img src="../images/giraffe-pics.png" alt="3 giraffe images, all 3 have the photo class and one also has the favourite photo ID">
            <p>You can then apply style rules to that class in CSS and it will apply to all of the photos - eg give them all a 5 pixel wide red border</p>
            <p>You can apply style rules to the ID in CSS and they will only affect the specified object. If those rules conflict with rules already applied (eg to the "photo" class, or to all img objects, the rules specified in the ID will take precidence. So in the above example, even though the "photos" class has a red border, you could specify that the "favourite-photo" ID will instead have a 10 pixel wide blue border.</p>
            <p>JavaScript and web browsers have functionality which trigger off ID attributes, which is why you should only have one object associated with an ID per page. One example of this is you can include an ID in your URL and the browser will zoom to that object eg. http://www.yourdomain.com#favorite-photo and the browser will take you directly to that image on the page.</p>
            <p>It may be tempting to add a class or ID to every object in your web page, but many styling rules could be applied at the tag level (as in all H1 headings for example) which could cut down on clutter in your code and make it easier to understand and debug.</p>
            <p>Thanks for reading, and have a great day.</p>
