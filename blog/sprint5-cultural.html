            <h3>
              What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
            </h3>
            <p>
              I'm just as happy working by myself as with others.
            </p>
            <p>
              No matter how much I tell myself not to, I always get a flash of "Of crap, I'm falling behind!" every time someone shares work which is ahead of me.
            </p>
            <p>
              The meditation stuff I've been learning on the Calm app has taught me that I can use metathinking to bounce myself out of any destructive thought 
              patterns and get back on track. That is exremely powerful.
            </p>
            <h3>
              What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Learning requires self awareness, particularly in the form of a growth mindset and acceptance of the fact that you don't know what you don't know, and 
              that's fine. Getting caught in negative thought processes and a fixed mindset serves to slow your learning progress, which can in turn contribute further 
              to a fixed mindset in a vicious cycle.
            </p>
            <p>
              Knowing yourself and how you approach problems, and recognising when to ask for help is important when working to a time constraint, as will often be the 
              case when working in a team environment or on a project which is not self-driven. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Empathy is a very important ingredient in effective teamwork, and approaching all situations from a place of kindness and genuine desire to reach a mutually 
              beneficial solution leads to a culture of trust and close co-operation. From a values perspective, everybody is human and deserves to feel supported when 
              they need help, and from a pragmatic perspective, if someone asks for help and feels attacked or like a burden, they are less likely to ask for help in the 
              future and will be less productive as a result.
            </p>
            <h3>
              What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Honestly, the power of meditation. I'd always assumed it wasn't for me, but dang. It's super handy for retaining focus, and keeping cool when things get 
              frustrating.
            </p>
            <h3>
              What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Codifying my core values. I guess I'd always thought of my values as a kind of a reaction to a situation, mutable depending on other factors, but it was 
              interesting to learn that I do have some overarching values, and also that they were so obvious to my friends and family.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
            </h3>
            <p>
              In my optinion, focusing on conecpts like neuroplasticity and growth mindset are crucial when we are being put into a position where we need to absorb a 
              lot of information extremely quickly and in a high pressure environment. And working on soft skills will make us more employable at the end of the course, 
              which for most of us is the ultimate goal.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Not in the slightest. The time spent learning core has made the time spent practicing coding more productive.
