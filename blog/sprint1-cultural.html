            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Identity, Values and Strengths</h2>
            <br>
            <h2>How I see myself</h2>
            <h3>My values:</h3>
            <p>I hold kindness and empathy in high regard, as well as allowing people to be their authentic selves.
                Further to this, I value honesty very highly, and encourage honest communication. I hate it when I feel
                like I'm being manipulated (compliment sandwich, obvious sales techniques etc)</p>
            <p>I have a strong sense of justice when it comes to recognition for effort. Eg. Pay disparity, being taken
                for granted. People should be allowed a healthy work/life balance.</p>
            <p>I love to collaborate, and love mentoring people too. I'm a helper. I like to help others achieve their
                goals.</p>
            <h3>My strengths</h3>
            <p>Communicator<br>
                Coach<br>
                Building rapport<br>
                Problem solving / Innovating</p>
            <h3>My Limitations</h3>
            <p>Lower than average self esteem<br>
                Willingness to help others sometimes affects my own time management<br>
                Outspoken if I think something is wrong (especially if I think it's a lie)</p>
            <h3>How my culture has influenced my values and identity</h3>
            <p>I'm a straight, white male from a middle class family. I have an awareness (and still a lot of blind
                spots, I'm sure) of the privilege that brings in our current society, and I always strive to be mindful
                of that and I try to be as inclusive and supportive of people as I can. I'm not especially versed in
                political science, but I identify as a left-leaning person, and I believe all people should be given
                opportunities and should be rewarded for contributing to society as best they can, not just for
                contributing to some rich person's yacht fund.</p>
            <h3>Describe an ethical decision I had to make</h3>
            <p>I was (still technically am) a manager of a retail store. I was at a meeting with the two owners of the
                business just after the first Covid lockdown and we were discussing hiring a new staff member, and the
                general consensus was that it was a risky proposition due to the uncertainty around the economy at the
                time. One of the owners started saying things like "There are plenty of people to hire right now, and we
                can pay them minimum wage, as a lot of people have lost jobs and are desperate", and phrases beginning
                with "Legally we don't have to..". I said that I believed he was being exploitative and that this method
                of hiring was not going to end up with a staff member who was ideally suited to the role or who would be
                motivated to stay long enough to become truly effective in the role.</p>
            <p>Using provocative words like "expolitative" are obviously a bad idea when trying to get your point of
                view across without making the other person defensive, especially to your boss, but I was a bit upset at
                the idea of treating employees like a disposable resource, and I just kind of blurted it out. I ended up
                getting banned from high level meetings going forward. So yeah, lesson learned there, hopefully.</p>
            <h3>Evaluating my strengths and limitations in terms of my learning and career development</h3>
            <p>This is all in a Customer Service context. I tend to learn quickly when I first start a job because I
                enjoy learning how systems work, and then I start on trying to optimise them. I quickly become the
                subject matter expert and (oftern informally) become a mentor to other staff members. Often my
                willingess to drop everything to help someone gets me in trouble further down the line with my own
                workflow, so it's a personal journey of mine to work on time management and saying no.</p>
                <p>Career development-wise, I've been made redundant 3 times and each time have ended up having to take
                another entry-level customer service job, I suspect ultimately due to not having the self confidence to
                apply for more advanced jobs or to interview especially well.</p>
                <p>I've been working a lot on my self esteem issues and that's led me to coming to Dev Academy as I've
                found the desire to invest in myself.</p>
            <h3>Identifying which of my strengths might help me in my learning journey and how they might intersect with
                learning obstacles</h3>
            <p>Problem solving, as the life of a programer is about understanding and solving problems. Coaching and
                building rapport, as I know that explaining a concept to someone aids in solidifying it in my own mind
                as well as helping the other person so it's win-win. I don't regard asking for help to be a weakness, so
                hope to be a positive influence on any people who might be shy about asking for help.</p>
            <h3>An example from my experience of where I was trying to work productively with others, but there was
                resistance or tension</h3>
            <p>At my retail job we work closely with a sister company who operate our shared website and fulfil online
                orders. I don't have visibility of their system or internal processes, so I often ask questions or
                request that the web team perform little tasks for our mutual benefit. The manager of that team is often
                very passive-agressive and will respond with belittling comments etc. My response to that is generally
                to remind him that I'm not trained in the same system as he is, explain the context of my request more
                fully through the lens of that missing information, and that normally works. I also try to internally
                empathise with him to make his manner less hurtful/irritating, as I happen to know he suffers from
                depression and so do I so I know how that can sometimes distort social interactions.</p>
            <h2>How others see me</h2>
            <h3>From plum.io - a recruitment service including a strengths assessment</h3>
            <p>1. Coach<br>
                Your objective is to develop people's potential. Contrary to what others might think, you believe that
                every person has the potential for development. None of the people have achieved the ultimate level of
                excellence - there is always space to grow. You perceive it as a personal mission to help others utilize
                their potential and to experience success. As the result, you look for ways to facilitate their learning
                process - from challenging their thoughts in a discussion to creating environments which would
                facilitate learning process. You are one of those leaders that really care about the development of team
                members and they really appreciate it.</p>
                <p>2. Empathiser<br>
                Your objective is to be empathetic to others' emotions. No one can step into the others' shoes better
                than you - it comes so naturally to you. You might not agree with every perspective and emotion, but
                most importantly you are able to understand what the person is going though. It allows you to have
                personalized approach to everyone, to see their differences and specialties, to include them and to
                treat fairly. Naturally, it draws others to you, as you know exactly how they feel. In a team, such a
                strength based on kindness can be essential for mitigating conflicts by making sure all team members are
                aware of each other's emotions and challenges.</p>
                <p>3. Brainstormer<br>
                Your objective is to come up with new concepts and ideas. It's not even your objective - it's your way
                of life. You are constantly on the lookout to connect unconnectable things and to find new perspectives
                on familiar challenges. Whenever a new idea comes into your mind, you literally lit up like a light
                bulb. New angles, approaches and perspectives no matter how contrary or bizarre give you an endless
                source of energy. As the result, the others might see you as an innovative person willing to turn the
                world around and resort to you if they need some 'out of the box' ideas. You are a clear source of
                creative juices in any team.</p>
                <p>4. Strategist<br>
                Your objective is to see the big picture. Have you heard about 'taking the helicopter view'? In your
                case, you are constantly on this helicopter! That's not even a skill, it's a special way of seeing
                things - a special perspective on the world at large, where everything is interconnected. While others
                could be confused by your short-terms steps, in your mind you have a clear multi-step strategy on how to
                arrive at the desired outcome and to avoid paths leading nowhere. Such a strategist is an essential
                asset for any team determined to find a clear direction in a complex situation.</p>
                <p>5. Commander<br>
                Your objective is to take charge and direct people. In any situation, you enjoy bringing yourself
                forward to lead the team. Moreover, you don't come empty handed - by that time your opinion and views
                are formed and you can't wait to align others with you. Contrary to others, in this process, you are not
                afraid of confrontation when presenting your views. At the contrary, you feel that the confrontation and
                the open discussion is the first step towards an agreement. People who have a clear vision and can take
                a stand for it always draw followers, so will you. If you also master listening to others, this strength
                will help you to be a good leader without fear of confrontation.</p>
            <h3>From friends and whanau - I just took this verbatim from a group chat I made for this purpose</h3>
            <p>Bea<br>
                Off the top of my head:<br>
                - Relationships. You put a lot of time and effort into making your relationships healthy.<br>
                - ^ addon to this is quality time with the people you love.<br>
                - Listening & seeing others. You really care about what people have to say and you notice what we/they
                care about. <br>
                - Work life balance. Work isn’t everything but you’re dissatisfied when you’re not being
                challenged/stretched. <br>
                - Playfulness. You’re quite silly and fun.<br>
                - You seem to value consideration/thoughtfulness/respectfulness- and so when someone is inconsiderate it
                seems to grind your gears. You also carefully consider & weight up your opinions.<br>
                - Personal boundaries. You value your own space and wellbeing.<br>
                - Like.. straightforward-ness? Forthcoming-ness? Bullshitless-ness? Maybe it’s direct honesty? You’re a
                straight shooter & like it when folks are the same back. <br>
                Puzzles - you value the challenge & problem solving to figure something difficult out.</p>
            <p>Kyle:<br>
                I would second everything that Bea said, and maybe even emphasize further the values around
                relationships and fairness – both from the point of view of looking out for others, but also wanting to
                be given a fair go yourself. I guess a platform of mutual respect and empathy? In that regard I would
                also say that you are open to others – whether it's a professional point of view, or just getting to
                know someone – as long as they are equally willing to hear/see/value your position.</p>
            <p>Josh:<br>
                Core values:<br>
                Family / Friendships: Close personal relationships with people that you care for and that care for
                you<br>
                Leisure: The ability to unwind, relax, and recover <br>
                Stability: Being able to plan a life and not have too many stresses (financial or time based)<br>
                Achievement / Attainment: Successful completion of personally important activities and projects<br>
                Authenticty: Being able to be yourself<br>
                --<br>
                Strengths: Loyalty, caring, educator, realistic, Creative, intelligent <br>
                Weaknesses: Difficult to externally motivate, lack of self belief / esteem</p><br>
