            <h3>What's EQ and how does it differ from IQ?</h3>
            <p>While IQ (Intelligence Quotient) is a measurment of a person's ability to understand and apply infromation to logical reasoning, mathematical problems, word comprehension and spatial thinking, EQ (Emotional Quotient, otherwise known as Emotional Intelligence) is the ability to identify, asses and control emotions, both in the self and others. </p>
            <p>There is fierce debate as to which is more important in a business setting.</p>
            <h3>Why is EQ so important?</h3>
            <p>There's a quote which goes "A high IQ will get you through school, a high EQ will get you through life." (I can't find the original author of the quote, sadly).</p>
            <p>Simply put, a high EQ allows someone to work well by themselves and with others. They are able to work with a broad range of people, and apply positive influence to acheive higher levels of productivity and positively affect morale. They are able to self motivate, and remain focused. This makes them attractive candidates for employers as they make for an easy team fit, and a productive worker.</p>
            <p>From a hypothetical employer's viewpoint, it may be a more attractive prospect to hire a candidate with a high EQ who would be easy to get along with and open to feedback but requires an amount of technical training to br brought in line with the other team member as opposed to a candidate with advanced technical skills, but an abrasive personality and difficuly working with others.</p>
