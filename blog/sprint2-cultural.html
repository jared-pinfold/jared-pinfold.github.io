      <br>
      <h3>What is my long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>Ultimately I'd like to do freelance work (at this stage I'm thinking about Web Development or UX, but I'm by no
        means done exploring) with a lot of opportunity to work from home to save on environmental impact and travel
        expense where possible.
        Before I can be a credible freelancer, I feel like I would require a few years of industry experience, with the
        social/contact networking that comes along with that. Happy to work for start-ups or established companies, as I
        have experience working in both environments in other capacities.</p>
      <h3>A description of my strengths and limitations in relation to learning:</h3>
      <p>I think I have good problem solving skills and attention to detail, and an ability to pick things up fairly
        quickly. I am able to compartmentalise information and understand that if I encounter a thing I don't
        understand, it will likely click into place properly once I learn another thing further down the road.</p>
      <p>Limitations-wise, if I encounter a road block, my natural way of working is to incubate the problem and mull it
        over for a while and come back to it, which especially in a fast paced bootcamp environment isn't a great way to
        work. I don't find it difficult to ask for help or feel ashamed or anything, it's just not the first place my
        mind goes to so I need to train my brain to find a sweet spot where I've spent enought time trying to find a
        solution myself and it's time to collaborate.</p>
      <h3>Skills (non-technical - human skills) I'd like to see developed in myself while at EDA:</h3>
      <p>Selling myself and negotiation skills. Conflict management.</p>
      <h3>An explanation of how I will manage myself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators
        and industry/community representatives:</h3>
      <p>I'll seek to establish a good rapport with others asap, and be respectful and inclusive at all times to develop
        a high degree of trust and cooperation within our working group.</p>
      <p>I'll employ time management techniques like time-boxing and pomodoro timers to keep me on track and will seek
        to establish a clear understanding on the nature of deliverables and when they are expected.</p>
      <p>I'll be travelling on public transport regularly, so I will observe all necessary Covid precautions.</p>
      <h3>What I will do when things are building up and starting to get to me:</h3>
      <p>I have a strong network of friends who are extremetly supportive and are good listeners. Some are already in
        the tech industry, and others have experience in retraining and juggling study and "adulting", and also with
        depression/anxiety.</p>
      <p>I'm also fortunate enough to have a sister who is also learning web development in Toronto, Canada, who is
        approximately a month ahead of where I am, learning-wise. We have a Facebook chat where we share interesting web
        pages, discuss what we're working on and provide encouragement to eachother. That's less of a timely help
        source, but super good for reflection at the end of the day.</p>
      <h3>How and where I will seek help in a timely way:</h3>
      <p>If I can't find the answer myself by googling, I'll seek assistance from my peers, or facilitator (depending on
        context). </p>
      <h3>What I expect from the facilitation team</h3>
      <p>Compassion, giving a clear expression of what is required of me, and being available to provide technical and
        occasional emotional support from time to time.</p>
      <h3>Any time that needs to be blocked out for external commitments?</h3>
      <p>I don't really have any scheduling commitments, as I have no dependents and I live with my partner, so don't
        need to block out specific time together.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Learning Plan - Sprint 5 update</h2>
      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        Having only been exposed to front-end stuff so far, my current plan is to seek employment as a front-end developer, or look at UX. I'll re-evaluate once we get 
        into back end stuff during the course.
      </p>
      <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p>
        Strengths will be teamwork and collaboration. Weakness will possibly be stamina with all of those hours of work. Also if I get really, <b><really/b> stressed I 
        can be a bit terse sometimes, which I look forward to hopefully not doing now that I'm on my meditation and mindfulness journey.
      </p>
      <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
      <p>
        Staying on top of the course material. There have been times during Foundations where I've been stuck on something and the clock is ticking, but I haven't been 
        toooooooo stressed about it because I've found I am slower on some things and whizz through other things. I get the impression that it might be easy to fall 
        behind on daily course material and it would be difficult to get back on track if I end up too far in the weeds.
      </p>
      <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
      <p>
        Conflict resolution and negotiation. Interviewing skills.
      </p>
      <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
      <p>
        Same as in my original answer from Sprint 2: Compassion, giving a clear expression of what is required of me, and being available to provide technical and
        occasional emotional support from time to time.
      </p>
      <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>
        Keep on top of time management. Don't waste this opportunity! Do my best to help anyone who needs it, so that we all cross the finish line feeling confident.
