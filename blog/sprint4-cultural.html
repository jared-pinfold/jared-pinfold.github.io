            <br>
            <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
            <h3>How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity beneft people?</h3>
            <p>It's inspirational. People who think they aren't good at something see an upswing in morale, effort and results when presented with the idea that the brain can change and grow. It's also practical. Once you have an understanding of the fundamentals of neuroplasticity, it can assist with learning or practicing any skill, ever. That's incredibly powerful.</p>
            <h3>How I'm engaging with the principals of neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p>Firstly, I explain what I'm learnign to my friends and family as often as I can, trying to reword and re-frame it to suit the audience each time.</p>
            <p>Also, I'm trying to base practical examples on things I'm familiar with, as they can leverage pre-existing neuro pathways:</p>
            <p>I have a background in board games, so in my spare time, I'm trying to make a website with a functioning Snakes and Ladders game in it (I hate that game, but it's a good, achievable first goal).</p>
            <p>I also have a lot of experience working with the website for the game store I currently work at, so I intend to try to make a replica of that site to try to exercise my HTML and CSS muscles, then to try to improve on some functionality.</p>
            <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity:</h3>
            <p>Repetition, in varying contexts. Do a thing, explain to someone how you do the thing. Reword the explanation. Do the thing with different inputs.</p>
            <p>Think about practicing a task. The act of thinking about doing something without the physical component of doing it still provides many of the benefits of physical practice.</p>
            <p>Mnemonics - for example if you're trying to remember which character goes before an ID in a CSS document, you could have the mnemonic "Has A Single Home" to remember the hash symbol is for IDs which should only be attached to a single thing. Also, when facilitator Josep makes a new directory in console he says "Mikdirrr" out loud, which really helped me to remember that particular command (and I say it in my head whenever I type it).</P>

            <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
            <h3>What is Growth Mindset and why is it relevant?</h3>
            <p>“A growth mindset is when students understand that their abilities can be developed,” - (Dweck, 2014).</p>
            <p>Growth mindset is relevant to students in particular because by the very nature of their endeavour they are developing their minds, and need to on some level understand that there is always the opportunity for skills to develop.</p>
            <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise me or change for me?</h3>
            <p>I noticed that there are quite a few common sayings which reinforce Fixed Mindset: - "You can't teach an old dog new tricks", "A leopard can't change its spots", "Once a [thing], always a [thing]".</p>
            <h3>How I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey?</h3>
            <p>I'm going to try to form a habit of adding "Yet" onto any statements about not knowing something. Mindfully looking forward to when I DO know something and realising that there are only a matter of a few stepping stones between my current state and the state I'd like to be in.</p>

            <h2>Blending Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset with my learning plan</h2>
            <h3>How might these understandings shape or influence my learning plan and strategy.</h3>
            <p>As part of the reflection process I will try to assess if I have any self imposed blocks telling me I can't acheive something, and address them.</p>
