            <br>
            <h2>Would you like to hear about that one time I got blocked on a simple problem?</h2>
            <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
            <p>
                I was working on a JavaScript kata (A repetitive exercise a la "Wax on, wax off" in Karate Kid), and it was asking me to use a .map method which I'd not been 
                exposed to yet.
            </p>
            <h3>What problem solving techniques did I use?</h3>
            <p>
                Firstly I looked the method up on Google. I hated the first example because it was super abstract and hard to wrap my head around, so I tried another 
                couple of places, including some random people's blogs as I figured they might have some more.. ground level.. examples. That kind of worked, and I felt 
                the germ of understanding start to grow.
            </p>
            <p>
                I then copy/pasted an example off Google into my own code, and set about changing it so that it would work in my function. Contextualising the 
                information like that helped with my understanding. It took some trial and error, but I got there in the end.
            </p>
            <h3>How did I feel throughout the process?</h3>
            <p>
                Sometimes frustrated, to be honest, but a lot of the time I was just up for the challenge. At my worst moments, I was fearing that I had accidentally 
                skipped over some rudimental piece of information which would have made all of this a lot easier to understand.
            </P>
            <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
            <p>
                In this instance I learned what a Fat Arrow does, which has opened up a bit of a door in terms of general understanding I think.
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h2>Would you like to hear another story? This one is about that time I solved a problem elegantly.</h2>
            <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
            <p>
                In the very next kata, I was asked to use a .find method, which I had also never used before.
            </p>
            <h3>What problem solving techniques did I use?</h3>
            <p>
                Again, I googled the method and this time I noticed that in the example, the syntax of the method was very similar to the one for .map, so I applied what 
                I had already learned, and was able to get the .find exercise to work quickly. Recognising similarities between problems and letting those guide you to the
                solution faster is a useful problem solving tool.
            </p>
            <h3>How did I feel throughout the process?</h3>
            <p>
                Vaguely confident, but still keeping on my toes. You never know when an unnoticed typo will strike, or if it'll turn out that what you think you know turns 
                out to be wrong. (Fun fact: I originally had a typo in that bit about unnoticed typos.. *sad trumpet*)
            </P>
            <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
            <p>
               Once you start noticing similarities between different methods, every time you encounter a new concept it's not an enormous monster you have to figure out 
               from scratch. Things start to seem a bit easier.
